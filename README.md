# ticketing

Ticketing Macro written with Python3.
I made this for my mom's birthday present to get a concert ticket she wanted to watch.

It needs Chromedriver to be installed.
This code is written for 'INTERPARK TICKET'.

I set the cursor points to my settings, so change it to your environment.

The telebot function will send RECAPTCHA images on Telegram when RECAPTCHA comes out, 
so you can check and input the letters on TELEGRAM and it will continue the seat searching.

If macro is succeeded in reserve a seat, it will send the result on Telegram you set.
